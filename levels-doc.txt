Level One
(Protect Your Data)  Level Two
(Know Your data)	Level Three
(Monitor Your Data)	Level Four
(Repair Your Data)
Storage and Geographic Location	
Two complete copies that are not collocated
For data on heterogeneous media (optical disks, hard drives, etc.) get the content off the medium and into your storage system
At least three complete copies
At least one copy in a different geographic location
Document your storage system(s) and storage media and what you need to use them
At least one copy in a geographic location with a different disaster threat
Obsolescence monitoring process for your storage system(s) and media
At least 3 copies in geographic locations with different disaster threats.
Have a comprehensive plan in place that will keep files and metadata on currently accessible media or systems
File Fixity and Data Integrity	
Check file fixity on ingest if it has been provided with the content
Create fixity info if it wasnâ€™t provided with the content
Check fixity on all ingestsUse write-blockers when working with original media
Virus-check high risk content
Check fixity of content at fixed intervals
Maintain logs of fixity info; supply audit on demand
Ability to detect corrupt data
Virus-check all content
Check fixity of all content in response to specific events or activities
Ability to replace/repair corrupted data
Ensure no one person has write access to all copies
Information Security 	
Identify who has read, write, move, and delete authorization to individual files
Restrict who has those authorizations to individual files
Document access restrictions for content
Maintain logs of who performed what actions on files, including deletions and preservation actions
Perform audit of logs
Metadata	
Inventory of content and its storage location
Ensure backup and non-collocation of inventory
Store administrative metadata
Store transformative metadata and log events
Store standard technical and descriptive metadata
Store standard preservation metadata
File Formats	
When you can give input into the creation of digital files encourage use of a limited set of known open file formats and codecs
Inventory of file formats in use
Monitor file format obsolescence issues
Perform format migrations, emulation and similar activities as needed
